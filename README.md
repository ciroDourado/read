Due to the complexity that writing some code that expects a string input from the user, I've made this tiny library which can be used in any case (e.g.: the programmer doesn't need to worry anymore of how many characters/bytes the user must give, neither the boring details of handling NULL or memory allocation).

With these functions, you should only expect some string (any size) or nothing, that simple.
